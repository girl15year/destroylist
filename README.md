## 🛡️ About Destroylist 💥
> ⚡ **Live data collection began on July 1, 2025**

Destroylist is a powerful tool against phishing and scams, powered by **PhishDestroy**. It provides reliable intel for:
- ✅ Firewalls
- ✅ DNS resolvers
- ✅ Browser extensions
- ✅ Threat platforms

Protect the web, one domain at a time! 🌐

## 🚨 Key Info for Online Fraud Victims 🚨

**Destroylist** aims to **disable malicious domains**, targeting scams, phishing, and other illicit sites to enhance internet safety.

Before a domain is added, we:
* **Scan it** across cybersecurity platforms for threat intelligence.
* **Send an official complaint** to the registrar and host (via WHOIS), detailing scan results, domain screenshots, and a request for client investigation. This complaint also notifies them of our public database entry.
* Per **ICANN rules**, registrars must review such complaints within **24 hours**.

If you've been defrauded by a domain already listed here, check its addition date via the **[commit history](https://github.com/phishdestroy/destroylist/commits/main/)** or our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/PhishDestroyAlerts) / [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@phishdestroy). If the fraud occurred *after* a domain was listed, the registrar or host's delay may imply they **share a degree of responsibility for your loss**. **Potential victims of their clients will also be aware of this information.** These "good-natured" providers, who tolerate scammers on their platforms, might be uniquely positioned to assist you or your legal representatives.

## 🚀 Update Process 🛠️
- 🔎 **Gather:** Continuous phishing domain collection via PhishDestroy.
- 🔄 **Sync:** Cross-check with trusted sources.
